## Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063) - Final Project 

### Milestone #3

#### Updated Schemetic Drawing

#### Finite State Machine
- Please click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qslxWGsJ-36B4F_gMpMzcs9AWAo9q5zi/view?usp=sharing).
- This FSM is for the red button (named 'redButton' in the p5.js code) and its logic will apply to the other buttons as well.

### Milestone #2

#### Write-up
- Please click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1udwkpx5haJ0bILWwHMvCfNQjeDVwN6pv9wwsej2UPOA/edit?usp=sharing).

#### About Test 01
- When the mouse is pressed, a randomized Superformula shape will be drawn.
- When the mouse is released, the shape stops drawing and the mouse can be pressed again to draw a new randomized one.
- To clear the canvas, press spacebar.

#### About Test 02
- Has a layering effect. Shapes will keep generating as long as the mouse is pressed.
- When the mouse is released, the layering effect ends with an animated shape.
- When the mouse is pressed again, the shape stops animating and the layering effect occurs again, covering it eventually.

### Milestone #1

#### Idea #1
- Utilizing [touch sensors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BPG115T1/ref=ewc_pr_img_2?smid=A2F4WL24P91UAV&th=1).
- Will be using up to 4 sensors, each representing a stem of a song sample (e.g bass, treble, vocals, percussion).
- When the user presses a sensor, the stem plays and is accompanied by a visual representing the stem on the monitor (p5.js sound).
- Can press on more sensors to achieve a layered effect of visuals and stems.
- For sketch, please refer to 'IDEA 1' in Sketches.

#### Idea #2
- Utilizing either a [rotary mode encoder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C6Q67V97/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1YZW40LYQY3L1&psc=1) or [ultrasonic sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BDFLPZ2R/ref=ewc_pr_img_4?smid=A2F4WL24P91UAV&th=1).
- There is an artwork constantly being generated in p5.js on the monitor.
- If using a rotary mode encoder module, the artwork reacts according to which direction the module is being turned.
- If using a ultrasonic sensor, the artwork reacts through proximity of the user.
- Found these links as inspiration: [link 01](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/genart-arduino-x-processing/) and [link 02](https://studioexpanse.com/physical-computing/serial-to-p5js).
- For sketch, please refer to 'IDEA 2' in Sketches.

#### Idea #3
- Utilizing either a [humidity detector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CF561CRZ/ref=ewc_pr_img_3?smid=A2F4WL24P91UAV&th=1), [temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BPFYQT8C/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A2F4WL24P91UAV&th=1) or [air quality sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B389LQCQ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1GMZO8N77UCMQ&psc=1).
- Visuals generated in p5.js changes depending on the condition of the atmosphere.
- If using humidity detector, the number of of raindrop and dry icons changes depending on the humidity levels (e.g. if humidity is high there will more raindrop icons and less dry icons appearing on the screen).
- If using temperature sensor, the palette of the visuals ranges from warm to cool depending on the temperature. (e.g. the visuals take on a warmer color palette if the temperature is high, and transitions to a cooler color palette as the temperature decreases).
- If using an air quality sensor, the visuals in the form of an uploaded image of choice will range from blurry to sharp or grayscale to colored depending on the air quality levels (e.g. the worse the air quality gets, the visuals get blurrier/desaturated. As the air quality improves, the visuals get sharper/colored).
- For sketch, please refer to 'IDEA 3' in Sketches.
